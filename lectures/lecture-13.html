# Cloud Computing

* **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
    - “Cloud computing is a model for enabling **ubiquitous**, **convenient**, **on-demand** network access to a shared pool of configurable **computing resources** (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”

* The first to suggest publicly (in 1961 in a speech given to celebrate MIT's centennial) that computer time-sharing technology might result in a future in which computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the utility business model (like water or electricity).

# Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

* To provision **processing**, **storage**, **networks**, and other fundamental **computing resources** where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software (e.g. virtual machines)
* Consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but have control over **operating systems**, **storage**, and **deployed application**s; and possibly limited control of select **networking components**

<center>
    <img src="img/l13-iaasproviders.png" width="90%"/>
</center>

---

# Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

* To deploy onto the cloud infrastructure **consumer-created or acquired applications** created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.
* Consumers have control over the **deployed applications** and possibly **configuration settings** for the application-hosting environment.

<center>
    <img src="img/l13-paasproviders.png" width="90%"/>

# Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

* To use the provider's **applications** running on a cloud infrastructure, which are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface.
* Consumer do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities

# Virtualization Technologies

* **Virtualisation** divides the resources of a computer into multiple **isolated** execution environments, by applying one or more concepts or technologies such as hardware and software partitioning, time-sharing, partial or complete machine simulation, emulation, etc.
<br/><br/>
<center>
    <img src="img/l13-cloud-system.png" width="70%"/>
</center>

# Hypervisors

* **Virtualisation** is enabled by software called **hypervisors**
* What does a hypervisor do?
    - Provide **isolated execution environment** for each VM
    - Manage **access of physical resources** by each VM
* Two types of hypervisors:

<br/><br/>
<center>
    <img src="img/l13-hypervisors.png" width="100%"/>
</center>

---

# Hypervisors

* Hypervisors get its name because it is conceptually **one level higher than a supervisory program (part of an OS)**.
* **Type 1** hypervisors run directly on bare metal instead of within an operating system environment - provide the best performance, availability, and security of any form of hypervisor.
* **Type 2** hypervisors run within an operating system environment running on the host computer - typically referred to as hosted virtualization

# Cloud Management Systems

* A layer above hypervisors
* **Manage** a cloud infrastructure, which may include many physical nodes, networking devices, storage devices, etc.

# Cloud Management Systems

### Some of the functions of a CMS:
* Resource allocation (Determine where to create a VM)
* Resource monitoring (Usage of physical resources)
* Enforcement of resource, security and configuration policies
* User management & billing
* VM image management
* User interface for on-demand self-service
* ...

# Auto-scaling

---

# Cloud & Scalability

### Cloud computing allows you to **add** or **remove** computing resources more quickly and easily
* Adding one more application server
* Adding new hard disk storage space
* Adding extra database servers
* ...

---

# Auto-scaling

* Given that everything is **virtual** in the cloud, all changes to the configurations of the virtual machines, applications, firewalls, etc., can be automated
* **Auto-scaling** refers to the idea of automatically adding or removing computing resources in the system **based on the actual usage** in real-time
* Auto-scaling can be triggered by **different rules**, for example:
    - Based on a schedule (E.g. start three more application servers during Christmas)
    - Base on demand (work load)
        - Example 1: start one more server if the average CPU utilization rate is over 80% for 10 minutes)
        - Example 2: stop one server if the average CPU utilization rate is less than 20% for 10 minutes)

# Case Study

* [Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog) is an online video streaming company and it servers millions of users at different times.
* However, the load on the system can be different at different hours and on different days

<center>
    <img src="img/l13-netflix-autoscale.png" width="50%"/>
</center>

* Imagine if you can predict the load on the application, you can auto-scale in advance
    - React to changes in demand more quickly
    - Save the amount of $$$ spent on unused resources

# Deploying Applications

### Deploy: to put your application into production

* How would you develop and deploy your application?
    - Set up a development environment to develop your app
    - Set up the production environment, and copy your application to the production machine
* **Problem?**
    - It takes time to set up the production environment

# Deploying Applications

### Does using **cloud** and **virtual machines** solve the problem?

# Deploying Applications

### **Limitations** of using Virtual Machines (VMs)

* They run on hypervisor, and thus are not particularly efficient in using the resources of the machine
* The size of the image is usually very large (at the order of GB)
* Requires some time to boot and start up (at the order of minutes)
* One physical machine can only support at most tens of VMs

---

# Docker

* [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) is a technology that provides virtualisation solution and allows a developer to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardised unit for deployment.
* A relatively **lightweight** virtualisation compared to VMs
* Applications run inside **containers** and are **isolated** from each other
* A container can be started in **seconds**
* More efficient use of computing resources on the machine

* **Image**:<br/>a read-only file containing the application
* **Container**:<br/>an instance of an image for executing the application
* **Repository**:<br/>where images are stored, like GitHub
    - Can be private or public
    - The largest public repository is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

# Creating a Docker Image

* To create a docker container that runs your application, you need to:
    - Create a docker image (usually from a **base image**)
    - This is done by write a **Dockerfile**, which describes how the image is created/built
* Let's say we have a very simple Web application written in Flask

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="localhost", port=5000)
```

---

# Creating a Docker Image

* We can create a docker image for this application using the `ubuntu:latest` base image
* Our Dockerfile:

```python
# Use the python3.6 base image
FROM python:3.6

# Set working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy our application file into the image
COPY app.py /app

# Install our dependency (Flask in this case)
RUN pip install Flask

# Run app.py when the container is launched
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

---

# Creating a Docker Image

* Building the **image** using the Dockerfile:
* (`-t` assigns a **tag** to the image created)

```bash
$ sudo docker build -t flask-app:1.0 .
```

* Creating a **container** running the app using the image built above

```bash
$ sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app:1.0
```

* Note: we **forward** connections on port 5000 of the host machine to the port 5000 of the docker container
